## SUVWAVE - CITY BOY ON ISLAND

### PART 1

From Tokyo, Senjo Makoto went to Futawai Island - where only about 300 people live - to do a project to report earthquakes on this island. He plans to stay on the island for a year and work part-time at a small restaurant. 
There, he meets Tsunahei Chugo - a 37-year-old fisherman with a large body. Chugo is always lonely and grumpy with everyone, including Makoto.
 
One day, while Makoto was chatting with his aunts at the diner, Chugo came in carrying a crate of fish. Makoto curiously asked him what was in the box. Chugo was annoyed and asked Makoto to use his phone to look it up. He also said that Makoto is a city person and doesn't fit in with island life. Then he quietly left. Seeing this, the aunts explained to Makoto: Chugo had lost his father at a young age, had to take care of his elderly mother, and divorced his wife after a year of living together. That's why he's hard to get along with.
 
After that, the aunts secretly wished that more young people like Makoto would stay on the island. An aunt asks Makoto to bring Chugo rice, but Makoto refuses for fear of Chugo's hatred. The aunt advises Makoto to be natural with Chugo so he won't be upset anymore. Makoto reluctantly agreed.
 
When Makoto arrives at Chugo's house, he finds Chugo's mother lying on the mat. She recognizes Makoto and asks if the aunts sent Makoto to bring rice to Chugo. Makoto is surprised and asks where Chugo is. She said that Chugo is taking a bath and going to bed early to get up early to go to the beach tomorrow. She also apologized for not treating Makoto better. Makoto put the rice on the table and said goodbye. She expects Makoto to be friends with Chugo because Chugo has no friends and would be happier if there was someone the same age as him.
 
After a while, Chugo came out of the bathroom with clothless and heard his mother talking. When he saw Makoto, he shouted: "What the hell is Makoto doing in my house?". Makoto suddenly saw his body naked which Chugo embarrassed. Chugo shouted to chase Makoto away. Makoto panicked and ran out of the house.
 
Makoto returns home and tells himself to be more careful with Chugo. He was masturbating himself and couldn't stop thinking about Chugo - a man with a large and stout body. He suddenly wanted to do something with Chugo and wanted to stay on the island to be closer to him

### PART 2
 
The next day, Makoto was busy serving meals to the aunts and fishermen at the small diner. He was surprised to see Chugo eating lunch at the next table. Usually Chugo never comes here. He recalled that he went to Chugo's house yesterday without his permission. When Makoto glanced at Chugo, he looked back with angry eyes. Makoto quickly turned her face away.
 
Makoto continued to chat with his uncles and aunts. An uncle praised Makoto for having a strong body and that he would be a good fisherman if he stayed on the island. An aunt tells the uncles not to bother Makoto because he has his own business. The uncle said that Makoto would be of great help to the people here. Makoto smiled wryly and said that he doesn't know anything about fishing. The uncle points at Chugo and says he has to teach Makoto how to fish. Chugo immediately protested and asked why it was him. The uncle also asked if it was fun to fish alone. The aunts also don't understand why Chugo is cold towards Makoto because of being seen naked.
 
The aunties said that if there was a handsome sea fisherman like Makoto on this island, girls would definitely flock to this island. Then the aunts wished Makoto would get married and have children and spend time taking care of these old ladies. Makoto sees this too soon and he is not ready. The aunts also advised that Makoto is over 30 years old and should get a wife soon..
 
After the uncles and aunts left, Makoto stayed behind to clean the restaurant and sighed. He thinks that because the island is so small, people expect too much from him. He then imagined what it would be like if he lived here and had a boyfriend. But he laughs because he doesn't have a boyfriend.
 
In the evening, Makoto took out his phone and opened the dating app. He recalls that he decided not to date anyone when he came to the island. He also thought of Chugo - whose sexy body he couldn't forget. He tried to do something to dispel the thought of Chugo but couldn't. He still uses the dating app in his hand.
 
On the day off, Makoto intends to take a bath at the public bathhouse. As he was greeting his aunts at the diner, a fisherman pulled him out to fish. Makoto didn't have time to react and was dragged along by him.
 
On the boat, the fisherman said that there was not much fish today and asked Chugo to go out with him. But when he looked for Chugo, he was already out. On the other hand, Makoto sat alone because he couldn't go to the public bath. Suddenly he finds Chugo fishing alone and thinks why not ask Makoto to come along. He immediately had an idea: to push Makoto over to Chugo's boat so that the two could get acquainted. Chugo was intently fishing when he suddenly saw Makoto standing on his boat. Before he could say anything, the fisherman sailed away and told the two to get along.
 
Makoto tries to talk to Chugo about how to fish but he doesn't answer. In the end, Makoto directly asks Chugo if he hates him. Chugo replies that he doesn't hate Makoto, just doesn't want to be friends. Since they were the only ones here, he turned to ask Makoto if he was gay. Makoto was startled and tried to deny it. He said that this was the first time anyone suspected he was gay. Chugo took out his phone and showed Makoto the dating app with Makoto's profile. Makoto was startled and surprised that Chugo was also gay and had been following him for a long time. Chugo says that he has been suspicious of Makoto since he first arrived on the island. Makoto says that the people of the island want the two to be closer and that he wants to be friends with Chugo. Chugo then says that for a man as good as Makoto, Chugo doesn't want to stop just to be friends.
 
Makoto asked what Chugo was saying just now. Chugo was embarrassed and avoided Makoto. He said he didn't say anything. Makoto kept forcing Chugo to answer until he came back and said that he likes Makoto.
 
Makoto moved closer to Chugo's face and suddenly kissed him on the lips. Chugo was startled and ran away from Makoto. Makoto followed and asked Chugo if he was annoyed by Makoto's kiss. Chugo shyly says it's not dislike and lets Makoto kiss him again. Makoto gives Chugo another passionate kiss and then act intimately with Chugo...
 
After having do love with Chugo, Makoto suddenly realized that he had crossed the line. He asked Chugo if he could go out with him again. Chugo says that this matter between the two should end here. Makoto is surprised and asks why. Chugo says he will let Makoto take all the fish he catches. Then he sailed away.
 
Makoto sat alone and watched the evening sea and was sad. An aunt comes and comforts Makoto that it's okay not to catch fish. Makoto continued to look at the sea and regretted having bothered Chugo.

### PART 3
 
A few days later, Makoto finds her aunt taping up a flyer announcing the island's festival. He went to ask his aunt about this festival. The aunt said this festival has not been held for a long time because the people on the island are less. But this year many young people like Makoto came to live, so she decided to reopen the festival to have some fun.
 
At that time, Chugo brought a box of fish into the restaurant. He greeted Makoto with a face that wasn't as cold as before. The aunts are also surprised and delighted to see that Chugo has become closer to Makoto since the two went fishing together. They also congratulate Makoto for making Chugo open up.
 
Makoto thanked the aunties but was worried inside. He knew that he and Chugo were just pretending to be close in front of everyone.
 
The next day, Makoto left the island and returned to the city. He met a friend he met online for a drink. The friend was surprised to learn that Makoto is from the city but lives on the island. He said that city people like them can't live on the island. He also says that he is living alone and invites Makoto to move in.
 
Makoto declined the friend's invitation. He thought in his mind that half a year had passed since he came to the island but he still hadn't had a good date. It is also difficult for him to find a boyfriend for himself.
 
On the day of the festival, Makoto and Chugo participate in the festival as palanquin carriers. Chugo wanted to refuse, but his uncle slapped his ass and forced him to join. Makoto saw Chugo's toned body and couldn't take his eyes off him. He had to look away to restrain himself. He saw many young men who were also palanquin carriers like him. While carrying the palanquin together, Makoto suddenly recognized Mr. Chugo with his loving eyes and happy smile. Makoto wants to remember but that.
 
After the festival, Makoto and Chugo celebrate together. Chugo decided not to drink alcohol because he had to take care of Chugo's mother. But an aunt said that today is a festival and she will take care of Chugo's mother. Chugo heard that and drank a glass of wine.
 
Chugo drank too much and got drunk. Makoto and an uncle had to carry him home. The uncle said that the Chugo house was too far away and suggested that Chugo stay at the Makoto house. Makoto is shy but the uncle says that the two are already close so it's okay. Makoto agrees to let Chugo stay at his house for the night.
 
Chugo wakes up a bit and asks Makoto where this is. Makoto says this is his house. Chugo was surprised and wanted to go home but fell to the floor because he was still drunk. Makoto tells Chugo that he should just stay and sleep and not disturb anything.
 
Makoto turned on the TV to watch the program. The TV showed Makoto participating in today's festival. Makoto on TV said that the festival was fun and that he would join again next year if there was one. Chugo heard that and said that Makoto will probably still be on the island until then. Makoto admits that he only has six months left on the island. He also said that he changed his mind when he saw Chugo laughing like that.
 
Makoto thought in his heart that the time left was too short. He wants to be with Chugo longer. Chugo wants to leave and doesn't want to listen to Makoto anymore because he seems drunk. But Makoto hugs Chugo from behind and apologizes if he did anything wrong. He asked Chugo if he had found his lover. Chugo said that he is not afraid of being found out as gay but there are many other reasons. He thinks it's hard to love a guy and he can't leave the island or invite anyone to the island. He thinks that if he loves Makoto, he will suffer when Makoto leaves. So he decided to stay away from Makoto.
 
But then Chugo turned around and hugged Makoto in his arms. He says that he doesn't want to lose a good friend like Makoto and doesn't want to give up his love either. He says that Makoto can do whatever he wants. Makoto flutters and kisses Chugo once. The two then spent an emotional and intimate night together.
 
The next morning, Makoto wakes up and doesn't find Chugo next to him. He went out and saw Chugo walking towards the sea. He ran after him and called Chugo's name. Chugo turned to look at Makoto and asked Makoto if we should continue doing this. Makoto asks if he regrets doing that. Chugo sat down on the sand and said if Makoto only said those words because he was drunk he could forget. He also asked what Makoto would do when his contract on the island ended. Makoto says he hasn't thought about it yet. He also said he is not good at being a fisherman. Makoto asks why Chugo didn't teach Makoto to be a fisherman. Makoto is also confident that he can become a better fisherman than Chugo.
 
Chugo then said that life on the island was difficult for the two of them. He got up and said he had to go home to see how his mother was. Before he left, he wanted Makoto to promise to only call him by his first name in private and by his last name when in front of others. Makoto nodded and understood what Chugo meant. Chugo smiled and walked away.

### PART 4
 
Gradually Makoto and Chugo also became closer, they became a couple. Chugo also often invites Makoto to go fishing, go for a walk on the beach, and have dinner at Makoto's house. They also keep their relationship a secret from everyone. Only Chugo's mother knows about their relationship. She is happy to see that her son has a lover and advises Chugo to keep Makoto.

Makoto is also happy to be with Chugo. He and Chugo also gradually understand each other. He also wants to stay on the island to live with Chugo.

But time waits for no one. Six months later, Makoto had to leave the island to return to the city. He completed the island earthquake report project. He also said goodbye to his aunts and uncles at the diner. They regret that a good young man like Makoto has to go and hope he comes back soon.

Makoto carried the luggage to the pier to board the ship to leave the island. He looks for Chugo but doesn't see Chugo here. He called Chugo many times but no one answered. He thinks maybe Chugo decided not to come see him off.

Makoto sadly boarded the train and sat down on a chair. He looked out the window and saw the vast blue sea. He thought that maybe he would never come back here again.

Suddenly, he heard the train whistle. He looked out the window and saw a small boat following the ship. On the boat was a large and stout man waving at him. That's Chugo.

Makoto rushed to the platform and called Chugo's name. Chugo also calls out Makoto's name and says that he wants to say something to him before he goes. Makoto asked what Chugo wanted to say.

Chugo says he wants Makoto to know that he loves Makoto and will always wait for Makoto's return. He says that he can't follow Makoto because he has to take care of his mother. He said that he would send Makoto letters every week and that he would keep in touch with Makoto by phone.

Makoto was surprised and touched to hear Chugo say that. He said that he also loves Chugo and that he will try to return to the island as soon as possible. He said that he would read Chugo's mail every week and that he would call Chugo every day.

Chugo also said that he was happy to hear Makoto say that. He says that he will wait for Makoto here and that he will miss Makoto every day.

Makoto and Chugo laughed happily and kissed through the window. They do not care about the admiring glances of the people around them. They just know that they have found the love of their lives.

Makoto boarded the train and returned to the city. He has found a new job and is about to return to the island. A week later, he received his first letter from Chugo. In the letter, Chugo tells about his life on the island, about his mother, and about his love for Makoto. He was also surprised to learn that his mother was also healthier than before. He also attached a photo of himself fishing in the sea.

Makoto is happy to receive a letter from Chugo. He picked up the photo and looked at Chugo's face. He misses Chugo a lot. He took out his phone and called Chugo. When she heard Chugo's voice, Makoto couldn't hold back her tears. He says that he loves Chugo and that he will come back to the island to see him again.

Chugo also couldn't hold back his tears when he heard Makoto's voice. He says that he loves Makoto and that he will wait for Makoto here.

They talked for a long time. They told each other about what had happened in the past week. They laughed and cried together. They promised to always love each other and see each other soon.

### PART 5

After talking with Chugo on the phone, Makoto decided to return to the island earlier than planned. He resigned from his job and sold all his belongings. He bought the train ticket and prepared the luggage. He called Chugo and said that he will be returning to the island tomorrow.

Chugo is surprised and delighted to hear the news from Makoto. He told his mother that Makoto was going to the island to live with him. His mother is very pleased and says that he must prepare well to pick up Makoto. He cleaned the house and prepared a delicious meal for Makoto.

The next day, Makoto boarded the ship and returned to the island. He brought luggage and a gift for Chugo. He got off the train and looked around the pier. He doesn't see Chugo here. He called Chugo but no one answered.

Makoto is worried and doesn't know what to do. He thought that maybe Chugo had forgotten he was going to the island today. He thought that maybe Chugo was busy with something and couldn't come pick him up.

Makoto decides to go find Chugo himself. He rented a motorbike and rode along the road leading to Chugo's house. He went through rice fields, small villages, and beautiful beaches. He felt the fresh and peaceful air of the island.

He came close to Chugo's house. He saw a small green house in the middle of a flower garden. He saw a woman sitting on a rocking chair on the porch. It was Chugo's mother.

Makoto stopped the motorbike and got off. He greeted Chugo's mother and said that he was Makoto, Chugo's friend. The old woman recognized Makoto and smiled. She has said that she knows who Makoto is and that she is happy to see Makoto back.

Makoto thanked Chugo's mother and asked her where Chugo was. She pointed towards the sea and said that Chugo was fishing in the sea. She said that Chugo left early this morning and hasn't come back yet.

Makoto thanked Chugo's mother and took her luggage. He said he would go find Chugo and come back later. She agreed and said that he was at home.

Makoto rode his motorbike to the nearest beach. He saw a small boat floating in the sea. On the boat was a large and stout man fishing. That's Chugo.

Makoto stopped the motorbike and got off. He called Chugo's name and waved at him. Chugo heard Makoto's call and turned to look at Makoto. He recognized Makoto and was surprised. He threw his fishing rod into the water and started rowing back to shore.

Makoto ran out to meet Chugo. The two hugged each other tightly and kissed each other passionately. They have said that they love each other and that they miss each other very much.

They got on a motorbike together and returned to Chugo's house. They greeted Chugo's mother and said that they would live together from now on. Chugo's mother was delighted and said that they had to prepare a delicious meal to celebrate.

Together they entered Chugo's room and put down Makoto's luggage. They sat down on Chugo's bed and hugged each other. They told each other about things that had happened during their time apart. They laughed and cried together. They promised to always love each other and never leave each other.

Makoto is happy for his friend and agrees to go to the city. He tells Chugo about his friend's wedding and asks Chugo if he wants to come with him.

Chugo is hesitant and says that he has never been to the city before. He says that he doesn't know anyone there and that he doesn't like crowds and noise. He says that he is happy on the island and that he doesn't need anything else.

Makoto says that he understands Chugo's feelings and that he doesn't want to force him. But he says that he thinks it would be fun to go to the city together and see new things.
